**Other Files:**

* myStyle.css holds all presentation stylings (color, font, spacing) for the web page and contains media queries for page responsiveness for various device sizes

**Other Notes:**
* Facebook link leads to "page not found", as my Facebook page is currently set to private
* Empty space with first paragraph on about page will eventually be filled in by more text
* Violin picture in about page is unusually positioned when trying to shrink width of page
* Bottom 4 social media icons are responsive to a large monitor and phone screen but are too small for a medium-sized screen
